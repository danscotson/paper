#Introduction
We investigated ceramic coatings.

Coatings were measured with X-ray diffraction.

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies on this topic but X-ray diffraction was not previously used.

A large uncertainty in modelling the behaviour of high temperature properties of the jet engine led to this work.
