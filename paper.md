#Introduction
We investigated ceramic coatings.

Coatings were measured with X-ray diffraction.

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies on this topic but X-ray diffraction was not previously used. This is an exciting addition since the only X-rays previously used were to check the researcher's broken arm.

A large uncertainty in modelling the behaviour of high temperature properties of the jet engine led to this work. This is because we are generally unsure.

#Simulations

We simulate the evolution of coating phases with X-ray diffraction. It is important to evolve the coatings in order to increase our number of entries into the Pokedex.

#Methodology

We compared our measurements of XRD diffraction with a model.
The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002.

#Results

The simulations indicate that XRD diffraction shows two phases.

# Figures

Figures go in their own section in a draft paper.

# Conclusions

We have made fantastic progress with our experiment. However, questions remain so we should get more money. Make that double more money to include collaborators.
