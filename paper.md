#Introduction
We investigated ceramic coatings.

Coatings were measured with X-ray diffraction.

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies on this topic but X-ray diffraction was not previously used.

A large uncertainty in modelling the behaviour of high temperature properties of the jet engine led to this work.

#Simulations

We simulate the evolution of coating phases with X-ray diffraction.

#Methodology

We compared our measurements of XRD diffraction with a model.
The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002.

#Results

The simulations indicate that XRD diffraction shows two phases.
